An AR data visualization framework that enables users to create immersive map-based visualizations using a spreadsheet. I presented a paper on the framework at IEEE AIVR 2019.

I helped develop the UI/UX of the application and the spreadsheet parser that converts the spreadsheet data into a 3D map visualization.
