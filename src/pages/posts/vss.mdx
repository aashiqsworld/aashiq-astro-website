A volumetric streaming framework we are developing that enables low-latency streaming of live volumetric data. We published an initial characterization of our method at the HotEdgeVideo Workshop at ACM MobiCom 2021.

I am developing a compression method that utilizes existing 2D video compression algorithms to efficiently encode and decode volumetric data while maintaining important visual features. I am also developing a rendering method that renders our compressed volumetric data as full human meshes.
