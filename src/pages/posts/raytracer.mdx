A CPU ray tracer, written in C++. I am writing this to validate my fundamentals in linear algebra and computer graphics from the ground up. I will continually update it with new features. Based on Peter Shirley's ray tracing book.

Current features:
• ray traced meshes (triangular)
• ray traced spheres
• materials (diffused, metal, dielectric)
• reflection/refraction
• physically-based camera
• ppm image output
