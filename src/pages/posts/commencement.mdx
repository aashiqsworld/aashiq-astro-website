We collaborated with the university to create an AR mobile experience for ASU graduates who couldn't attend their ceremonies due to COVID.

We volumetrically captured the ASU President delivering his commencement speech. I developed the volumetric data compression and rendering method that enabled us to store hours of volumetric footage on mobile devices. I also managed the undergraduate team that created the digital assets and choreographed the virtual stage experience.
