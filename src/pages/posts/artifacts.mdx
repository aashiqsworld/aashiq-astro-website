For my senior capstone project, I managed a team that developed an AR Museum Curation framework that empowers museums to build virtual exhibits in AR at a lower cost than physical exhibits. We collaborated with the Arizona Museum of Natural History and the NASA Psyche-Inspired Art Exhibition to create their virtual museum exhibits and display them at open nights.

I developed the AR application that the user and the museum curator interfaces with, as well as the REST API and the backend database that stores the museum exhibits. After project completion, the framework continued to be used in projects such as the virtual exhibit for the Walton Sustainability Solutions Festival.
