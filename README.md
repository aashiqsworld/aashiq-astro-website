# Aashiq's Personal Website

#### Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## 🚀 Project Structure

```
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/ [main website pages]

│   └── layouts/ [layout templates]
│   └── components/ [reusable components]
│   └── assets/ [images, hosted files, etc.]

```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
